<h2>The Godfather</h2>
<p>
  This movie might be 3 hours but thats what makes it so good. It will make you
  so attached to the characters. It is the lifestyle everyone wants to live. The
  cinematography was perfect, and it has a rich and complex story. It is one of
  the most well known movies of all time and is considered the GOAT of all
  movies. Many of the actors in the Godfather had turned out to be all time
  greats and went on to have histroic carrers.

<h2>Happy Gilmore</h2>
<p>
  Happy Gilmore is such a funny movie to watch with your family. It is
  everything the average man could ask for. It has golf and fighting and it has
  some romance involved in the movie. It is family friendly and great to watch
  with kids. The story is about a violent sycopath who plays golf and is
  randomly good at it. He dresses like a slob while going to all these
  prestigious tournaments to golf.

<h2>Rocky</h2>
<p>
  Rocky was one of the most motivational movies I have ever watched. It got me
  so pumped up and it is a movie I will forever remember. The story of Rocky
  Balboa coming from nothing and becoming heavyweight champion will be something
  that I will always remember for the rest of my life.
